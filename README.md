# Airsoft M72 LAW

Made with Aluminium and PVC pipes plus 3D printed parts. 
This design uses 40mm Airsoft/Paintball shells loaded in the rear.

The design is a work in progress, and there are faults with the current design files.

ToDo:
- Strengthen the rear cap hinge
- Mechanism to lock open/closed
- Indirect fire sights

The photos show the latest printed prototype.
